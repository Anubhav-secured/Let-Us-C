(a) * or /, + or – represents the correct hierarchy of arithmetic
operators in C.

Answer: True

(b) [ ] and { } can be used in Arithmetic instructions.

Answer: False

(c) Hierarchy decides which operator is used first.

Answer: True

(d) In C, Arithmetic instruction cannot contain constants on left
side of =

Answer: True

(e) In C ** operator is used for exponentiation operation.

Answer: False

(f) % operator cannot be used on floats.

Answer: True

(a) In y = 10 * x / 2 + z ; 10 * x operation will be performed first.

(b) If a is an integer variable, a = 11 / 2 ; will store 5 in a.

(c) The expression, a = 22 / 7 * 5 / 3 ; would evaluate to 5.

(d) The expression x = -7 % 2 – 8 would evaluate to -9.

(e) If d is a float the operation d = 2 / 7.0 would store 0.285714
in d.
